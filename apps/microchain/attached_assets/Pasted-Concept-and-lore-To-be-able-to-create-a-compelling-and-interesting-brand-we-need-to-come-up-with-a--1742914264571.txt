Concept and lore
To be able to create a compelling and interesting brand, we need to come up with a concept around the brand and a backstory that helps contextualize what we are doing. This creates the backdrop and frame that all of our marketing efforts revolve around, and it motivates all the marketing campaigns we do.  
The Microchain universe
The idea behind the new brand is “What would a DEX look like if it was a hardware product in 1980s wall street?”. This is the universe within which our new brand exists, and it informs all of our visual branding as well as any marketing activities that we do. 
The Microchain universe is similar to our own, but with one key difference. Approximately 66 million years ago, the catastrophic meteor destined for Earth veered just one degree off its original trajectory. This seemingly minor change saved the dinosaurs from calamity, and not only allowed them to survive but thrive. Over millennia, they evolved from dominant reptiles into intelligent, humanoid creatures with sophisticated societies.
By the dawn of civilization, these humanoid dinosaurs, known simply as "Dinos," had developed cities, cultures, and advanced technologies reminiscent of our own historical trajectory—yet fundamentally unique. Their society mirrored ours in many ways, from art and culture to science and finance. Yet, the key differences lay in their inherent boldness and appetite for calculated risk, traits inherited from their prehistoric ancestors.
The evolution of technology among the Dinos largely mirrored our own historical timeline, with key innovations emerging at similar intervals. The internet arrived prominently in the early 1970s, driven by collaborative global efforts reminiscent of ARPANET. However, in 1978, a visionary Dino scientist working on early ARPANET protocols introduced blockchain technology as a novel mechanism to transparently distribute research funding among universities. The Dino's natural appetite for risk and innovation allowed blockchain technology to become quickly integral to early internet infrastructure.
A defining moment came in 1982 with the passing of President Reagan’s Digital Assets Deregulation Act (DADA). This landmark legislation explicitly deregulated digital assets and blockchain technologies, reflecting Reagan's philosophy of minimal governmental intervention. Under DADA, blockchain and digital currencies were legally recognized and encouraged, fueling rapid growth, innovation, and widespread adoption.
Enter the 1980s—an era of unabashed excess, ambition, and innovation. While in our universe the DeFi Summer emerged in 2020, in the Microchain universe, this transformative period coincided perfectly with the booming financial markets of the 1980s. Wall Street thrived on speculation, deregulation, and new decentralized financial mechanisms, leading to a wave of innovation in decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and token trading. 
Microchain.Systems emerged as the cornerstone of this boom, designed as a revolutionary hardware product embodying the era’s cutting-edge aesthetics and futuristic promise. In 1985, the visionary team behind Microchain.Systems came together to create the groundbreaking DLM-2000—short for Decentralized Liquidity Machine. This physical trading terminal quickly became iconic on Wall Street, enabling traders to exchange assets permissionlessly and without fees, decades ahead of its time. The DLM-2000 was just the first product in an innovative series of hardware terminals that Microchain.Systems would continually refine and update, cementing the company's legacy of technological excellence.
The Dino traders, investors, and technologists behind Microchain.Systems quickly rose to prominence, distinguished not just by their formidable intellect, but by their uniquely dinosaurian flair for bold financial plays. Led by visionaries who saw blockchain’s potential long before their contemporaries, these humanoid dinosaurs built a financial empire where decentralization and free-market ideals flourished, shaping a vibrant culture around their DeFi ecosystem.
The characters
Derek Dino, the stoic CEO of Microchain.Systems, belongs to the powerful and iconic Tyrannosaurus race. Born during the optimistic post-war era, Derek was deeply influenced by the Space Race between Dino nations, fostering a lifelong passion for ambitious ventures. His exposure to the global economic upheavals of the 1970s, including inflation and oil crises, forged his belief in decentralized, transparent financial systems. Derek’s decisive leadership was crucial in steering Microchain.Systems through the energetic but volatile 1980s financial boom, guiding the company to legendary status.
Fossil Frank, the Chief Technology Officer and a brilliant Velociraptor, was a young genius fascinated by the technological optimism of the late 1960s and early 1970s. His relentless curiosity led him to blockchain technology, initially designed to distribute research funding transparently among universities. Frank immediately recognized broader implications, adapting blockchain into practical financial products and services. Known as the company's "golden goose," his boundless energy and enthusiasm laid the technical groundwork for Microchain.Systems and the DeFi ecosystem.
Brian Bronto, the Chief Strategic Officer and an energetic Brontosaurus, thrived during the vibrant cultural shifts of the disco era and the subsequent transition into the 1980s financial boom. Brian's charismatic personality and salesmanship skills developed during these culturally rich periods enabled him to identify and close significant strategic partnerships. His knack for networking and negotiation made him instrumental in securing Microchain.Systems' leading position in decentralized finance.
