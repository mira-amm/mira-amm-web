1. Terminal App and Mini-Game Requirements
User Story:
As a user, I can visit the website microchain.systems and immediately see a cryptic, retro-styled terminal interface designed with ASCII art aesthetics reminiscent of 1980s computing.
When arriving at the site, I'm presented with a password-protected screen that intrigues me and sparks curiosity about what lies behind it.
Upon successfully entering the discovered puzzle password, the terminal grants me access, displaying private strategic notes from Derek Dino, offering insights into market developments and hints about future updates.
Within this secure terminal, I notice a countdown timer prominently displayed, clearly counting down to an anticipated launch event, synchronized with actual launch timing.
I also see an option to engage in an interactive, ASCII-based retro-styled mini-game, which is both simple to play yet challenging enough to encourage repeated attempts and competition.
As I play, my scores and multipliers are tracked and clearly displayed, allowing me to see my progress.
After achieving a high score, I'm prompted to enter my wallet address directly within the game, securely linking my score to my identity.
My score then appears on a public leaderboard alongside other usernames or wallet addresses, fostering a sense of community and competition.
