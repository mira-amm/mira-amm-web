ðŸ‘‹ MIRA is an
open-source, decentralized platform designed to seamlessly match
<span className="animate-color-cycle-emerald">traders</span>,
<span className="animate-color-cycle-rose">liquidity providers (LPs)</span>, and
<span className="animate-color-cycle-blue">protocols</span>.

Launching initially as a basic Automated Market Maker (AMM), MIRA is evolving into a [ve(3,3)](https://medium.com/@chaisomsri96/introduction-to-ve-3-3-4c873841e4ac) model to maximize capital efficiency and user incentives.

## Our Vision

The goal of MIRA is to create a dynamic and customizable liquidity landscape.

By enabling permissionless incentive mechanisms, protocols can boost their liquidity through bribes and other incentives, resulting in deeper markets and a better trading environment for all users.

## Why build on [Fuel](https://fuel.network)?

To revolutionize global finance, we need blockchains that can scale efficiently while maintaining strong performance and security. Low latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.

Fuel fits this profile perfectly. It tackles the key challenges that Web3 developers face today, including performance, scalability, interoperability, and state management.

Fuel also enhances Ethereumâ€™s capabilities by using UTXO-based parallel execution, which boosts efficiency and transaction speed, similar to what Solana offers, but with Ethereumâ€™s liquidity.
