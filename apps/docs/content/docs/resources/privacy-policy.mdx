Mira Protocol (“we,” “us,” or “our”) operates the website https://mira.ly/ (the “Website”) and the Mira Protocol. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use the Website and the Mira Protocol. By accessing or using the Website or Services, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Website or any services associated with Mira Protocol.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do not collect personal information directly from users unless explicitly provided by the user (e.g., email submissions or support requests). However, certain non-personal information may be collected automatically:

### a. Blockchain Interaction

The Mira Protocol operates on a decentralized blockchain, and all transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain. When you use the Protocol, your wallet address and transaction history may be publicly visible, but this data is not collected or stored by Mira Protocol.

### b. Automatically Collected Information

We may automatically collect certain technical information when you access the Website, including:

- **Log Data**: This includes your IP address, browser type, device information, pages visited, and the time and date of your visit.

- **Cookies and Tracking Technologies**: We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience on the Website, for analytics, and to monitor Website performance. You can control cookie preferences through your browser settings.

## 2. Use of Collected Information

We may use the information collected from you for the following purposes:

- **Website Performance and Monitoring**: To optimize and ensure the smooth functioning of the Website and Services.

- **Security**: To detect and prevent fraudulent activities or security threats.

- **Analytics**: To analyze Website usage and trends to improve our Services.

- **Legal Compliance**: To comply with any applicable legal obligations.

## 3. Sharing of the Information

We do not share the information that you provide us with other organizations without your express consent, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We disclose information to third parties under the following circumstances:

- **Affiliates**: We may disclose your information to our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates (i.e., our family of companies that are related by common ownership or control) for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.

- **Business Transfers**: We may share the information when we do a business deal, or negotiate a business deal, involving the sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets. These deals can include any merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding.

- **Analytics Partners**: We use analytics services such as Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. These services may also collect information about your use of other websites and online resources.

- **Compliance with Laws**: We may share the information for legal, protection, and safety purposes. We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with applicable laws; (ii) respond to law enforcement requests and legal processes, such as a court order or subpoena; or (iii) protect our rights, property, and safety, our employees, agents, customers, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and terms of use.

- **Service Providers**: We may share information with those who need it to do work for us. These recipients may include third-party companies and individuals to administer and provide the Service on our behalf, as well as lawyers, bankers, and auditors.

- **Consent**: You may permit us to share your information with other companies or entities of your choosing. Those uses will be subject to the privacy policies of the recipient entity or entities.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Our Website and Services may contain links or API connections to other websites, products, or services, such as https://fuel.network or similar platforms, that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy and confidentiality practices of these third-party services.

Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third-party API providers or any information you disclose to these third parties. We recommend you read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.

## 5. Blockchain Data and Public Information

Due to the decentralized nature of the Mira Protocol, any transactions you perform using the Protocol will be recorded on the blockchain, which is public and accessible by anyone. This includes your wallet address, transaction details, and interactions with other users. We do not have control over how blockchain data is used by third parties, nor can it be altered or deleted once recorded.

## 6. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to secure the information collected through the Website, including encryption and other security practices. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for securing your wallet and private keys when interacting with the Mira Protocol.

## 7. Retention of Information

We retain data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. Non-personal, technical data may be retained indefinitely to support website analytics and performance monitoring.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- Access the personal data we have about you (if applicable);

- Request corrections to any inaccurate data;

- Request deletion of your data.

To make any such requests, please contact us at legal@mira.ly.

**Note**: Since the Mira Protocol operates on a decentralized blockchain, we cannot modify or delete information stored on the blockchain.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

The Website and Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If we discover that such information has been inadvertently collected, we will take steps to delete it promptly.

## 10. Cross-Border Information Transfer

Please be aware that your information will be transferred to, processed, and stored outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). By using the Website and the Mira Protocol, you consent to the transfer of your information, including personal information, outside of the EEA as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA to countries that are not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal information protection, the transfer will be based on a data transfer mechanism recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal information.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may revise and update this Privacy Policy at our discretion. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly. Your continued use of the Website and Services following any updates constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
