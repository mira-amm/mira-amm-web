MIRA is an open-source, decentralized platform designed to seamlessly match traders, liquidity providers (LPs), and protocols.

Launching initially as a basic Automated Market Maker (AMM), MIRA will evolve into a ve(3,3) model to maximize capital efficiency and user incentives.

## Our Vision

The goal of MIRA is to create a dynamic and customizable liquidity landscape.

By enabling permissionless incentive mechanisms, protocols can boost their liquidity through bribes and other incentives, resulting in deeper markets and a better trading environment for all users.

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 - Basic AMM (Current):** Deploying as a basic Automated Market Maker to establish the foundational platform.

2. **Phase 2 - Transition to ve(3,3):** Evolving into a ve(3,3) model to introduce advanced governance and incentive mechanisms for long-term sustainability.

## Building on Fuel

To revolutionize global finance, we need blockchains that can scale efficiently while maintaining strong performance and security. Low latency and high throughput are a must!

Fuel fits this profile perfectly. It tackles the key challenges that Web3 developers face today, including performance, scalability, interoperability, and state management.

Fuel also enhances Ethereum’s capabilities by using UTXO-based parallel execution, which boosts efficiency and transaction speed, similar to what Solana offers, but with Ethereum’s liquidity.
