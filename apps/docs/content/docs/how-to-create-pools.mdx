### Choose Assets

You need to have both selected assets on your wallet balance to create a pool with them.

To do it, click on the arrow next to the empty field - and choose an asset from the dropdown list.

If the needed asset is not available on the list, fill in the asset ID. You can find asset IDs by connecting your wallet in the [Fuel Block Explorer](https://app.fuel.network).

### Set Exchange Rate

Fill in the amount of the asset X you think is reasonable to exchange for the asset Y.

This sets the starting price of the pool.

### ðŸ¥³ Congrats!

You've created your first pool on Fuel.

After you create a pool, you can go back to the liquidity page to see it in the list of your liquidity positions and the list of pools below.

The tokens that you added to the pools, can now also be swapped on MIRA.
