Comment keywords are special annotations in your code that various IDEs and tools can recognize. These keywords help developers flag areas needing attention, such as bugs, optimizations, or questions.

### Common Keywords

| Keyword    | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TODO**   | Something to be done later.                                                         |
| **NOTE**   | General comments about code decisions.                                                          |

### Tooling Support

- [**todo-comments.nvim**](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim): A plugin for Neovim that highlights and searches for TODO comments and other keywords in your project.
- [**Codetag (PEP 0350)**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0350/): Python Enhancement Proposals specifying conventions for comments used to annotate code.
- [**JetBrains IDEs**](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-todo.html): Documentation on how JetBrains products like IntelliJ IDEA handle TODOs and other code annotations.
- [**FixmeComment**](https://wiki.c2.com/?FixmeComment): A discussion on the use of FIXME comments in code, highlighting practices and considerations.

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Always accompany a keyword with a clear and concise explanation of what needs to be done.
2. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review comments to address important issues and ensure comments remain relevant.
3. **Prioritize**: Use the urgency and importance of the comment to prioritize development tasks.
4. **Keep Updated**: Update or remove comments as changes are made to ensure that they accurately reflect the state of your codebase.

### Variable Naming Conventions (WIP)
Constants are all caps with words being separated by underscores.
